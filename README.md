# MusicEqualizer

Sound equalizer is a basic tool in the music industry. It also serves in several biomedical applications like hearing aid industry. 

Run ```MainWindow.py``` to run the GUI

In collabration with [Ahmed Khaled](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8) and [Nancy Salah](https://github.com/NancySalah)

- 10 equalizer bands. The default gain of each when opening a new signal is 1. In dividing the sub-bands, the user can choose, and change on-the-fly, from a set of windows (rectangular, Hamming, Hanning).

- The user can view: the original signal, its Fourier transform, the equalizer bands and their gains, the output signal and its Fourier transform, the difference between the original and result signals along with its Fourier transform (this should not be shown by default but when the user asks for it, it should show as a popup window).

- sw can open a music file (you can choose any format you like), play it inside your sw, then play the result inside your sw as well, then be able to save the output in a new sound file that can played in other players. The user should be able to keep playing the source nad results several times to recognize/appreciate the effect that your software has done.

- The user can generate two results and start comparing them (through graphs or by listening) in the same session to compare which effect is more desirable for him/her.
